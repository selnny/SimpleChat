		<!-- 
		IMPORTANT: The "Host" setting must be configured differently depending on where the client application is running:

		- On the SAME machine as the server (i.e., for local testing):
			Set value="127.0.0.1" (or "localhost").
			This ensures the client connects to the server via the loopback interface.

		- On ANY OTHER machine in the local network:
			Replace "127.0.0.1" with the actual IPv4 address of the SERVER machine (e.g., "192.168.100.105").
			Alternatively, you may use a hostname like "myserver.local", but ONLY if:
				(a) the server's IP has been mapped to "myserver.local" in the client machine's 'hosts' file 
					(located at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts), OR
				(b) your network has a local DNS server that resolves "myserver.local" correctly.

		Example for remote clients (in App.config on the client machine):
			<add key="Host" value="192.168.100.105"/>
		OR
			<add key="Host" value="myserver.local"/>

		Note: Using "127.0.0.1" on a remote client will cause it to try connecting to itself (not the server),
		resulting in a "connection refused" error because no server is running locally.

		Always verify the server's current IPv4 address using 'ipconfig' on the server machine before deployment.
